This is a web application that aims to display a nice dashboard of your resources across multiple projects in an [OpenShift](http://www.openshift.org/) instance.

## How It Works

It is a [Go](http://golang.org/) webapp that uses the OpenShift API to build a dashboard, based on [Start Bootstrap - SB Admin 2](https://github.com/IronSummitMedia/startbootstrap-sb-admin-2).

* If the application is running in a container **in an OpenShift Cluster**, it will connect to the OpenShift API Server using the information available from the environment (mainly the service account token secret).

* If the application is not running in an OpenShift Cluster, it uses the default configuration file to connect to the OpenShift API Server. So it requires that you **login with the `oc` client** before starting the application.

It displays a summary of the following resources:

* [Routes](https://docs.openshift.org/latest/architecture/core_concepts/routes.html#overview)
* [Services](https://docs.openshift.org/latest/architecture/core_concepts/pods_and_services.html#services)
* [Pods](https://docs.openshift.org/latest/architecture/core_concepts/pods_and_services.html#pods)
* [Containers](https://docs.openshift.org/latest/architecture/core_concepts/containers_and_images.html#containers)
* [Images](https://docs.openshift.org/latest/architecture/core_concepts/builds_and_image_streams.html#image-streams)
* [Builds](https://docs.openshift.org/latest/architecture/core_concepts/builds_and_image_streams.html#builds)
* [Deployments](https://docs.openshift.org/latest/architecture/core_concepts/deployments.html)
* and... **Applications**

### Applications

The dashboard also groups resources by **applications**. An application is just a logical wrapper for multiple resources. You can assign resources to an application by setting a label named `application` on each resource (object):

  ```
  - kind: SomeObject
    metadata:
      name: myobject
      labels:
        application: myapplication
  ```

The dashboard will then extracts all declared applications from the labels of your resources.

* **Why not use [projects](https://docs.openshift.org/latest/architecture/core_concepts/projects_and_users.html#projects) to represents applications**?
  * Because we could have multiple applications shared in a single project, or some projects which produces [builds](https://docs.openshift.org/latest/architecture/core_concepts/builds_and_image_streams.html#builds) and [images](https://docs.openshift.org/latest/architecture/core_concepts/builds_and_image_streams.html#image-streams), but are not applications.

## Running on OpenShift

If you want to deploy this dashboard on an OpenShift cluster, you can use the provided [template](openshift-template.yml), that will create all the required resources:

* a `dashboard` [Service Account](https://docs.openshift.org/latest/architecture/core_concepts/projects_and_users.html#users) that will be used by the running [pod](https://docs.openshift.org/latest/architecture/core_concepts/pods_and_services.html#pods)
* a [Build Config](https://docs.openshift.org/latest/architecture/core_concepts/builds_and_image_streams.html#docker-build) that will use the [Dockerfile](Dockerfile) to build the [Docker image](https://docs.openshift.org/latest/architecture/core_concepts/containers_and_images.html#docker-images)
* a [Deployment Config](https://docs.openshift.org/latest/architecture/core_concepts/deployments.html#deployments-and-deployment-configurations) that will deploy a simple [pod](https://docs.openshift.org/latest/architecture/core_concepts/pods_and_services.html#pods) with a single [container](https://docs.openshift.org/latest/architecture/core_concepts/containers_and_images.html#containers)
* a [Service](https://docs.openshift.org/latest/architecture/core_concepts/pods_and_services.html#services) in front of the [pod](https://docs.openshift.org/latest/architecture/core_concepts/pods_and_services.html#pods)(s)
* and a [Route](https://docs.openshift.org/latest/architecture/core_concepts/routes.html#overview) to expose the [service](https://docs.openshift.org/latest/architecture/core_concepts/pods_and_services.html#services) to the outside world

**Using the [template](openshift-template.yml) is very easy** (and the recommended way to install the dashboard on OpenShift):

* if you don't already have a project, create one

  ```
  oc new-project dashboard
  ```
* create a new application from the template, and override some parameters

  ```
  oc new-app -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vbehar/openshift-dashboard/master/openshift-template.yml -p APPLICATION_NAME=dashboard -p DASHBOARD_TITLE="My OpenShift Dashboard" -p ROUTE_DNS=dashboard.somedomain.com
  ```

* if a build does not start, you can start one with

  ```
  oc start-build dashboard
  ```

* Wait a little for the build to finish, the following deployment to succeed, and... that's it! You can now open your browser at the configured route DNS, and you should have a nice dashboard.
* The next step is to give more rights to your [service account](https://docs.openshift.org/latest/architecture/core_concepts/projects_and_users.html#users) so that it can see other [projects](https://docs.openshift.org/latest/architecture/core_concepts/projects_and_users.html#projects): to do that, we will add the `view` role to our `dashboard` service account for all the projects you want to display in the dashboard

  ```
  oc policy add-role-to-user view system:serviceaccount:{DASHBOARD_PROJECT}:dashboard -n {NAME_OF_THE_PROJECT_TO_DISPLAY_IN_THE_DASHBOARD}
  ```

  for example, if the dashboard application is deployed in the `dashboard` projects, and you want to show projects `project1` and `project2` in the dashboard:

  ```
  oc policy add-role-to-user view system:serviceaccount:dashboard:dashboard -n myproject1
  oc policy add-role-to-user view system:serviceaccount:dashboard:dashboard -n myproject2
  ```

* The last step is to create [applications](#applications), by adding an `application` label to your objects.

**Alternatively**, you can just use the pre-build [Docker image hosted on Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/vbehar/openshift-dashboard/):

* create a new application from the `vbehar:openshift-dashboard` image

  ```
  oc new-app vbehar/openshift-dashboard
  ```
* expose the service through a new route

  ```
  oc expose service openshift-dashboard --hostname=dashboard.somedomain.com
  ```

Note that if you choose to deploy without the template, the [pod](https://docs.openshift.org/latest/architecture/core_concepts/pods_and_services.html#pods) will use the `default` [service account](https://docs.openshift.org/latest/architecture/core_concepts/projects_and_users.html#users), and you will need to either:

* create a new [service account](https://docs.openshift.org/latest/architecture/core_concepts/projects_and_users.html#users), edit the [deployment config](https://docs.openshift.org/latest/architecture/core_concepts/deployments.html#deployments-and-deployment-configurations) to configure the [pod](https://docs.openshift.org/latest/architecture/core_concepts/pods_and_services.html#pods) to use your new [service account](https://docs.openshift.org/latest/architecture/core_concepts/projects_and_users.html#users), and redeploy
* or give more rights to the `default` [service account](https://docs.openshift.org/latest/architecture/core_concepts/projects_and_users.html#users) (not recommended)

## Running locally

If you want to run it on your laptop:

* clone the sources in your GOPATH

	```
	git clone https://github.com/vbehar/openshift-dashboard.git $GOPATH/src/github.com/vbehar/openshift-dashboard
	```
* install 
	* [godep](https://github.com/tools/godep): for using the vendored dependencies

	  ```
	  go get github.com/tools/godep
	  ```
	* [gin](https://github.com/codegangsta/gin): for live-reloading the web server

	  ```
	  go get github.com/codegangsta/gin
	  ```
* configure the environment (in dev mode, caching is disabled)

  ```
  echo "GO_ENV=dev" > $GOPATH/src/github.com/vbehar/openshift-dashboard/.env
  ```
* Login with the `oc` client: it will create a config file that will be used by the dashboard app to connect to the OpenShift API.

	```
	oc login [...]
	```
* start the web server on port 8080 (don't forget the `--godep` option, to use `godep` to retrieve the vendored dependencies)

	```
	gin --godep --port 8080 run main.go
	```
* open <http://localhost:8080/>
